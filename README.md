content.json (in the gh-pages branch) is where all the resources are defined. In each resource there is a name of the technology, a short description, what the user should learn next, and an ordered list of resources related to that technology. There are a few things to keep in mind when doing editing:

* All names MUST be lowercase (even in the $then fields and descriptions)
* Descriptions should be NO MORE than 100 characters long
* Descriptions should NOT use any complex jargon when possible
* Home should be the top domain when possible
* Next lessons to follow-up with ($then) are in no particular order in the array
* Next lessons should NOT include prerequisites (javascript should not be in angular $then)
* Each LINK (not the box) must be categorized as "easy" (level: 0, no previous experience necessary), "medium" (level: 1, requires "easy" information), and "hard" (level: 2, requires "medium" information)
* Only the FIRST TWO "easy" links are shown, in the order of the array
* Link names should be the title of the destination
* Links should take the user DIRECTLY to the relevant information (i.e. for html go to the html exercise in codecademy, rather than codeacademy's home page)
* Make sure that if you are testing locally to open in Firefox - Chrome does not allow for local pulls of JSON files
